# MLCCI-Experiment

# MLCCI code

**The experiment is divided into two parts, one is MCLLI approach and the other is Fuzzy Weighted KNN approach which is baseline.**

## Running MCLLI approach experimental code

1. Executing the main function of **featureExtract.py**, obtain the results of four feature calculations.

2. Executing the main function of **Me2.py**, calculating CC recognition results, including *Recall*, *Precision*, *FPR* and *F1-score*. In addition, obtaining the random forest's training model.

3. Executing the main function in **Location.py** to calculate the list of suspicious statements.

4. Executing the main function in **FaultMe.py** to get the metrics of fault localization which contains *Wasted Effort* and *Accuracy@N*.
